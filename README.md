# MCM-CSD
This repository contains the dataset and code for our paper: MCM-CSD: MULTI-GRANULARITY CONTEXT MODELING WITH CONTRASTIVE SPEAKER DETECTION FOR EMOTION RECOGNITION IN REAL-TIME CONVERSATION

## Quick Start
### Requirements
Install related dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Dataset
In this paper, we focus on the text-based ERC, while some datasets are video resources. The original datasets can be found at [IEMOCAP](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/),[MELD](https://github.com/declare-lab/MELD),[DailyDialog](http://yanran.li/dailydialog

) and [EmoryNLP](https://github.com/emorynlp/emotion-detection).

Besides, we also provide the processed datasets(only in textual modality) that we use. You can download it from https://pan.baidu.com/s/18bp5mmQjYGLiRBs7HdNqzw.
